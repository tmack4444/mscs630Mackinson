   * Ok, I took a ton of time to get here but just to be sure I don't forget...
   * So, this works by calculating our x and y as we calculate the gcd
   * Instead of calculating the GCD and working backwards, I'm working backwards forwards
   * That probably doesn't make any sense, but basically rather than use the remainders, quotients
   * and other values we generate to work backwards to create our x and y, I Instead
   * use those values as we generate the GCD. We end up at the same result, and it doesn't
   * require me to do anything confusing, like create a string of all the vars and then somehow
   * turn that string into a formula with the values parsed in... That's where I was going before this
